## **1. Information We Do NOT Collect**

Unstuck Physics is designed to be a purely educational resource. We fundamentally believe that learning should be accessible and private. Therefore, we want to be absolutely clear:

* **No Personal Information:** We do not collect any personally identifiable information from our users. This means we do not ask for, store, or process your name, email address, IP address, location data, or any other data that could directly identify you.

* **No Accounts or Logins:** There are no user accounts or login features on Unstuck Physics. You can access all content without needing to register or provide any personal details.

* **No Behavioral Tracking:** We do not track your individual browsing habits, specific content consumption patterns, or any other behavior on our site for personalized advertising or profiling.

* **No Cookies for Personal Identification:** We do not use cookies or similar technologies (like web beacons or pixels) to identify individual users or track their activity across our site or other websites.

* **No "Sensitive" Information:** As we collect no personal information, we certainly do not collect any sensitive personal information (such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, health data, sexual orientation, etc.).

## **2. Data Processing and Sharing**

Since we do not collect any personal information from you, it follows that:

* **No Processing of Your Information:** We do not process your personal information because we do not collect it.

* **No Sharing with Third Parties:** We do not share any personal information with third parties, as we do not have any to share.
