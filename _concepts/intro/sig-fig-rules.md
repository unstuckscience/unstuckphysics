Significant figures are a way to show how precise a measurement is. Knowing which digits are "significant" helps us avoid pretending our measurements are more accurate than they really are.

## **What are Significant Figures?**

Significant figures (often called "sig figs") are the digits in a measurement that carry meaning and contribute to its precision. They include all the digits you are certain of, plus one estimated digit.

For example, if you measure a length as 5.2 cm with a ruler, the '5' is certain, and the '2' is your best estimate between the marks. Both are significant. If you then measure it with a more precise tool as 5.23 cm, the '3' becomes the estimated digit, and you have more significant figures.

## **Rules for Counting Significant Figures**

Here are the main rules to determine which digits in a number are significant:

1.  **Non-zero digits are always significant.**
    * Example: `23.45` has 4 significant figures.
2.  **Zeros between non-zero digits are significant (called "sandwich zeros").**
    * Example: `1005` has 4 significant figures.
3.  **Leading zeros (zeros before non-zero digits) are NOT significant.** They are just placeholders.
    * Example: `0.0025` has 2 significant figures. (The zeros before '2' are not significant).
4.  **Trailing zeros (zeros at the end of the number):**
    * **Significant if the number contains a decimal point.**
        * Example: `1200.` has 4 significant figures.
        * Example: `2.00` has 3 significant figures.
    * **NOT significant if the number does NOT contain a decimal point.**
        * Example: `1200` has 2 significant figures. (The zeros are just placeholders).

## **The Link to Uncertainty**

At its core, the reason we use significant figures is to show the **uncertainty** of a measurement. The last significant digit is always the one you are estimating, and it tells us exactly how precise the tool was.

For example, a measurement of $12.3 \text{ cm}$ (with 3 sig figs) suggests your ruler was precise to about $0.1 \text{ cm}$. The last digit, the `3`, is the one you estimated. It's really a quick way to say the measurement is $12.3 \pm 0.1 \text{ cm}$. .

Using significant figures is a common shortcut for reporting uncertainty in science.

{% include quick-concept-question.html
  question="How many significant figures are in the measurement 0.004050 meters?"
  answer="There are **four** significant figures. The leading zeros (0.00) are not significant. The '4' and '5' are significant. The zero between '4' and '5' is a sandwich zero, so it's significant. The trailing zero after '5' is significant because there's a decimal point in the number."
