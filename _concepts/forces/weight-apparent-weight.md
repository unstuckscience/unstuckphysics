## **What is True Weight?**

Your **true weight** is simply the **force of gravity** acting on your mass. It's the force with which Earth pulls you downwards.

* **Formula:** $W = mg$
    * $W$: Weight (in Newtons, N)
    * $m$: Mass (in kilograms, kg)
    * $g$: Acceleration due to gravity (approximately $9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$ near Earth's surface)

Your true weight is generally constant as long as your mass doesn't change and you stay at the same distance from the center of the Earth.

## **What is Apparent Weight?**

Your **apparent weight** is the **normal force** exerted on you by the surface you are standing on (like a scale, or the floor of an elevator). It's what you *feel* as your weight.

* **Why it's different:** Apparent weight can differ from true weight when you are in a non-inertial (accelerating) reference frame. This is because the normal force must not only counteract gravity but also provide the force needed to accelerate you.
* **What a scale reads:** A bathroom scale measures the normal force it exerts on you, which is your apparent weight.

## **Interactive: Elevator Ride**

Step into the elevator and observe how your apparent weight changes with different accelerations!

## **Scenarios for Apparent Weight**

Let's apply Newton's Second Law ($\Sigma F = ma$) to understand apparent weight:

* **Forces:**
    * $F_N$: Normal force (upwards, this is your apparent weight)
    * $W$: True weight ($mg$, downwards)

* **Equation:** $\Sigma F_y = F_N - W = ma_y$
    * So, $F_N = W + ma_y$

1.  **Elevator at Rest or Constant Velocity ($a_y = 0$):**
    * $F_N = W + m(0) \implies F_N = W$
    * **Apparent Weight = True Weight.** You feel normal.

2.  **Elevator Accelerating Upwards ($a_y > 0$):**
    * $F_N = W + ma_y$
    * Since $ma_y$ is positive, $F_N > W$.
    * **Apparent Weight > True Weight.** You feel heavier.

3.  **Elevator Accelerating Downwards ($a_y < 0$):**
    * $F_N = W + ma_y$ (where $a_y$ is negative)
    * Since $ma_y$ is negative, $F_N < W$.
    * **Apparent Weight < True Weight.** You feel lighter.

4.  **Elevator in Free Fall ($a_y = -g$):**
    * $F_N = W + m(-g) = mg - mg \implies F_N = 0$
    * **Apparent Weight = 0.** You feel weightless. This is because the floor is accelerating downwards with you, so it doesn't need to push up on you.

## **Why Weight and Apparent Weight Matter**

* **Understanding "Weightlessness":** It explains why astronauts in orbit feel weightless (they are in continuous free fall around Earth), even though Earth's gravity is still acting on them.
* **Roller Coasters:** The "pit of your stomach" feeling on a roller coaster is due to changes in apparent weight.
* **Conceptual Clarity:** It helps distinguish between the fundamental force of gravity and the sensation of weight, which is a contact force.

{% capture weight_apparent_weight_question %}An astronaut is in orbit around Earth. Does the astronaut have true weight? Do they have apparent weight? Explain.{% endcapture %}
{% capture weight_apparent_weight_answer %}Yes, the astronaut still has **true weight** because Earth's gravity is still pulling on them (though slightly less than on the surface). However, they have **zero apparent weight** because they are in a continuous state of free fall around the Earth, meaning there is no normal (support) force acting on them.{% endcapture %}
