**Kinematics** is the study of how objects move, focusing on their **position, velocity, and acceleration** without considering the forces that cause the motion.

## **What is Kinematics?**

**Kinematics** is the part of physics that talks about motion. That means how things move: how far they go, how fast they go, and how their speed changes.

We donâ€™t worry about what causes the motion (like forces or pushes and pulls). We only focus on what the motion looks like.

In this unit, we look at motion in a straight line.

## **What Words Do I Need to Know?**

Here are some words weâ€™ll use a lot in kinematics:

* **Position** â€” Where something is.
* **Displacement** â€” How far something moves from where it started.
* **Velocity** â€” How fast something moves *and* which way.
* **Acceleration** â€” How much the velocity changes (speeding up or slowing down).

In one dimension (a straight line), we use **+** and **â€“** signs to show direction.

## **The Kinematic Equations**
When something speeds up or slows down at a **steady rate**, we say it has **constant acceleration**.

We can use these special equations to solve problems about motion.

### 1. Final velocity after a certain time:
$$ v_f = v_i + at $$
- $v_f$: final velocity
- $v_i$: initial velocity
- $a$: acceleration
- $t$: time

---

### 2. Distance moved after a certain time:
$$ \Delta x = v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 $$
- $\Delta x$: how far the object moved
- $v_i$: initial velocity
- $a$: acceleration
- $t$: time

---

### 3. Final velocity without using time:
$$ v_f^2 = v_i^2 + 2a \Delta x $$
- $v_f$: final velocity
- $v_i$: initial velocity
- $a$: acceleration
- $\Delta x$: displacement

---

### 4. Distance using average velocity:
$$ \Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t $$
- $\Delta x$: displacement
- $v_i$: initial velocity
- $v_f$: final velocity
- $t$: time

These only work if **acceleration is constant** (doesnâ€™t change).

## **Why Should I Care?**

Kinematics helps you:

- Describe motion clearly
- Understand how objects speed up or slow down
- Solve real-life problems (like how long it takes a car to stop or how far a rocket travels)

Youâ€™ll use kinematics to build your skills for harder physics topics later on.

  answer="You should use: $$\Delta x = \frac{1}{2}(v_i + v_f)t$$ It uses the average velocity to find the displacement."
