  <p><strong>Problem 1:</strong> $15 \text{ m}^2$ (The least number of significant figures is 2, from 1.5 m).</p>
  <p><strong>Problem 2:</strong> $140 \text{ km/h}$ (The least number of significant figures is 2, from 2.5 h. Note: the zero in 140 is a placeholder, not significant).</p>
  <p><strong>Problem 3:</strong> $64 \text{ cm}^3$ (The least number of significant figures is 2, from 5.2 cm).</p>
  <p><strong>Problem 4:</strong> $3.2 \text{ g/mL}$ (The least number of significant figures is 2, from 2.5 mL).</p>
  <p><strong>Problem 5:</strong> $1.7 \times 10^2 \text{ years}$ (The least number of significant figures is 2, from $2.5 \times 10^3$).</p>
